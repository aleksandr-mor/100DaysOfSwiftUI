//The important part is making three buttons that respond to the player’s move: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
//Use the font() modifier to adjust the size of your text. If you’re using emoji for the three moves, they also scale. Tip: You can ask for very large system fonts using .font(.system(size: 200)) – they’ll be a fixed size, but at least you can make sure they are nice and big!


//Start off with the simplest logic you can: three buttons, each with logic that says “the player tapped rock, the player was trying to win, and the app chose scissors, so add 1 point.”
//Once you have that working, look for a way to simplify your logic such as an array of which items beat each move. For example, if your moves array was ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"] your array of winning moves would be ["Paper", "Scissors", "Rock"].
//You don’t need to add graphics if you don’t want to; just some text views and buttons is enough. Why not try emoji?
